# HTML Resume Project

HTML file used to produce high quality resume and printed to PDF.

## Getting Started

Edit HTML to whatever you like, then print as PDF from the web browser. For best results, I used Microsoft
Edge and selected Microsoft Print to PDF function. Then sized the job to 50% and selected narrow margins. 

### Prerequisites

1) Code editor such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime, Textmate, etc.
2) Web Browser (Microsoft Edge preffered).
3) Print to PDF functionality in web browser.
